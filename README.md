### Notes
I work with a school mac book. I started the assignment and change two different mac books because the version of X-code, when a new project is created, did not have a main.Storyboard. This took much of my time. After installing the AlamofireImage pods from my terminal, I had an error message in my moviesViewController that said "could not build Objective-C module 'AlamofireImage'. " Thus, I was not able to fully complete the project.
